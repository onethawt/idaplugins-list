# Call To Action

This repository is quite popular and spans all versions of IDA. If you can help categorize plugins based on version, it would be much appreciated. Submit a PR!!!


# A list of IDA Plugins

I'll be organizing the plugins over time. Please submit PRs if you have any other outstanding plugins. I would like to tag each plugin with its corresponding IDA version, but it will take me a long time to test. If you can help there, please do. 

**If a plugin is only a source repo with no description or documentation, I am not adding it.**

# **TODO**
- [ ] Add more plugins
